    "    1.2 Choose a significance level  - \n",
    "    \n",
    "The significance level is a threshold for determining if the test is valid. (A probability threshold that determines when you reject the null hypothesis) It gives credibility to our hypothesis test to ensure we are not just luck-dependent but have enough evidence to support our claims. We usually set our significance level before conducting our tests. The criterion for determining our significance value is known as p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lower p-value means that there is stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, and therefore, a greater degree of significance. A p-value of 0.05 is widely accepted to be significant in most fields of science. P-values do not denote the probability of the outcome of the result, they just serve as a benchmark for determining whether our test result is due to chance.\n",

    "T-test is used for comparison of two sets of data when we don't know the population standard deviation. It's a parametric test, meaning it makes assumptions about the distribution of the data. These assumptions include that the data is normally distributed and that the variances of the two groups are equal. In a more simple and practical sense, imagine that we have test scores in a class for males and females, but we don't know how different or similar these scores are. We can use a t-test to see if there's a real difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Z-test is used for comparison between two sets of data when the population standard deviation is known. It is also a parametric test, but it makes fewer assumptions about the distribution of data. The z-test assumes that the data is normally distributed, but it does not assume that the variances of the two groups are equal. In our class test example, with the t-test, we can say that if we already know how spread out the scores are in both groups, we can now use the z-test to see if there's a difference in the average scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chi-squared test is used to compare two or more categorical variables. The chi-squared test is a non-parametric test, meaning it does not make any assumptions about the distribution of data.
