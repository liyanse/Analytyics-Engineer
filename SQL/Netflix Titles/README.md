### Netflix Movie Title Analysis with SQL
The dataset was collected from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)

## About this Dataset: 

Netflix is one of the most popular media and video streaming platforms. They have over 8000 movies or tv shows available on their platform, as of mid-2021, they have over 200M Subscribers globally. This tabular dataset consists of listings of all the movies and tv shows available on Netflix, along with details such as - cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc.

## SQL
For this project, I'll be working with Microsoft SQL Server because it allows me to import excel sheets into the server
I have arranged the file into questions to allow e to get a better understanding of the dataset before we start with visualization.

1. Question 1

Understand the table before we get started

The dataset has the folowing columns; show_id, type	title, director, cast,country,date_added,release_year,rating,duration,listed_in and	description.

Initially the data has a total of 6235 rows but I removed duplicate values in the title column to remove shows that appeared twice.

2. Question 3

How many Directors of shows are missing from the dataset

1920 rows are empty in the Director's column. They were either left blank or the data was not accessible

3. Question 4

Who are the most prolific producers of Netflix shows?

    - Ra√∫l Campos, Jan Suter with 18 movie titles
    - Marcus Raboy with 14 movie titles
    - Jay Karas with 13 movie titles
    - Jay Chapman with 12 movie titles
    - Martin Scorsese with 9 movie titles
